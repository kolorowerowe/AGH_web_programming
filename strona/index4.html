<p>Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Didn't you know you had that 
much 
power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You need the dark in order to show the 
light. This is the way you take out your flustrations. The man who does the best job is the one 
who is happy at his job. Fluff that up.</p>

<p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. A happy cloud. Now it's 
beginning to 
make a little sense. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>

<p>We'll put a happy little sky in here. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever 
will be. You're special. You're so very special. It's amazing what you can do with a little 
love in your heart. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.</p>

<p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. This 
is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the 
puppy dog around and all that so. You can do anything your heart can imagine. You have to 
allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>

<p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Of course he's a happy little 
stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>

<p>Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. All kinds of happy little 
splashes. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Fluff that up. Just let go - and 
fall like a little waterfall. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>

<p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is the way you take out your 
flustrations. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to 
others through painting. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.</p>

<p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Now we can 
begin working on lots of happy little things. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or 
your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Just 
make a decision and let it go. This is a fantastic little painting. Use absolutely no 
pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>

<p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let all these little things happen. Don't 
fight them. Learn to use them. Don't fiddle with it all day. Get tough with it, get strong. 
All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife.</p>
